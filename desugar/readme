This is an attempt to take 'sugared' pieces of Haskell code from
Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! (http://learnyouahaskell.com) 
and 'desugar' them.

Sugaring is syntactic shortening and/or simplification intended
to make code look more presentable. In this specific context, the
'do' notation in Haskell allows IO-driven programs to be written
in a manner similar to imperative programs written in languages
like C, thereby reducing the learning curve for beginners who
are unaccustomed to Haskell's brand of strict functional 
programming.

By desugaring these snippets of code, the 'do' notation is replaced
by the 'pure' underlying features provided by Haskell to work with
the IO monad, like the binding and sequencing operators.
